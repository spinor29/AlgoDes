### Introduction ###

This depo include code I wrote for some algorithms, including Merge Sort, QuickSort, random contraction, strongly connected components (SCC), dijkstra shortest path, hash table, and heap algorithm. The code were written mainly for the assignments for Tim Roughgarden's algorithm course I took in 2014.
